  <p class="is-size-4">About me</p>
  <p class="is-size-6">
    I'm a PhD student at Purdue University working on deep neural networks w/ <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugenioculurciello">Eugenio Culurciello</a>. I'm passionate about using AI to help make the world a better place (atleast by a teeny tiny bit). I enjoy working in small teams and taking on big responsibilities.<br/>
    I'm currently an ML Engineer Intern at Micron Technologies. Before this, I worked as a part-time Research Engineer at <a href="https://fwdnxt.com">FWDNXT</a> in conjunction with my PhD. I was also the Founding Engineer at <a href="https://www.perceiveinc.com">Perceive</a> before I decided to pursue my PhD.<br/>
    Outside of work, I enjoy dancing (mostly competitive ballroom), playing MOBAs and cooking.
